# Github Login Exercise

## Goal

Setup a github account and create your own repo.

Github is a web service that hosts git repos.  We have been using a shared account
now it is time to register your own account and set up your own repo.


## Steps

### Sign up for Github

Sign up for a free account at Github.com.  This will be useful to you after you
are done with this class.

If you need to create private repos that others cannot see then you can convert 
the free account later.

You now have to manage two different accounts at Github (your personal github and
UNC-CS350).  Both account will contain very different content.

### Create a Repo

Now create a Code Repository named "Software-Engineering".  This repository will 
be used as your private record of your work in this class.

Create folders and put an Index.md in each

* Lectures
* Exercises
* Code

### Post your Github Account Name

Login to the UNC-CS350 github account.

Edit the file "Exercises/Results/Github-Accounts.md" and add your info.
