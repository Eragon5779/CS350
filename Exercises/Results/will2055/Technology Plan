           Popularity   |                    Future                   |   Community   |    Expertise
Arduino|Largely Popular | Growing with Robotics and IoT applications
Open Source and a main stay on almost all electronic forums and hobbyist sites
Beginner Level with little barrier to entry
Raspberry Pi
Largely Popular
Small but growing with Robotics and rapidly growing with IoT applications
Open Source Linux Operating System and is a large component of electronic forums and hobbyist sites
Medium Level with little barrier to entry (basic understanding of Linux is needed)
Android
Very Highly Popular
Future growth looks strong with an estimated 84% market share
Slightly Open Source where developers can use the Android Development Kit to write applications largely based on Java
Medium to Moderately High level with low barrier to entries (ADK and IDE are free to download)

 *This project is largely out of my scope of expertise. I'm really reaching hard to understand any of the tools needed for this kind of application. I did my best interpretation of what would be needed for this kind of application with what I could find.

I have completed this assignment to the best of my ability. I know so little about tools needed for this kind of application development that I wouldn't have bid to contract it in the first place. This is a small disclaimer if I'm completely wrong about the functions of a few tools. I researched as well as I could and derived my applications of each tool as best as I could.
