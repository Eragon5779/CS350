User account creation story: Joe:
Today I created a new account for that social media platform [insert title]! It was super easy, I just gave it my email and a password and my page was up in no time. It had me setup two step verification with my cellphone number as well as 3 other security questions during my account setup. I added a profile image and selected a wall image for my profile page. It also showed me that my account could be deleted any time after two-step verification has been completed. 
User unique timeline story: Jill:
I logged into my [insert title] account today and scrolled through my timeline for way too long, I think I may have an addiction to [insert title]! It’s just so easy to waste time when I can see all my friends posts and the posts from the cooking and school groups I follow. I also can remove any posts I dislike from my feed instantly, which really makes the experience more enjoyable. 
User generated posts story: Joel:
Today on [insert title] I decided to flood my friends with posts about my visit to Washington DC. I created a post explaining my thoughts on the current sitting president, then I added a picture of the National Mall, and a video of myself and my family walking through the Smithsonian. I got a huge amount of likes on all my posts, as well as comments asking how I enjoyed the day! I noticed a typo in my post commenting on the president and also realized it disagreed with my relatives so I blocked Uncle Charles from being able to see that one post and corrected the typo. 
Friend/user interaction story: Josephine:
I talked with a friend in my Psych class today about dogs and I friended her on [insert title] as soon as I got home from class. Then I realized that I was still friended with a fake bot account, so I unfriended them. I made a post discussing my love for dogs, and a cat lover would not stop commenting, so I was forced to block them. Then another cat lover called me some not very nice things and I reported them, I had no idea the discourse between cat and dog lovers would be this toxic! I messaged my new dog lover friend about it using the built in direct messaging system.
