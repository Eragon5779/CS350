Fateh M. Amin

Framework one: .NET framework/C#
•	Popularity: There are many businesses today that do much of their developing with the .NET frame work, the syntax is identical to Java because the same person that created java created C#. 
•	Future: Microsoft has invested so much into the MSDN website and one can see that when using the MSDN website as reference when codding, and that’s way I strongly believe it will only become more popular with programmers.
•	Community: I think there is so much resource out there for the .NET but I personally think the MSDN website is all the developer will need. The way it is set up, its impossible to need anything else.
•	Expertise: beginner because I am well under 100 hour of practice with C#.



Framework two: Java IDE
•	Popularity: Java is one of the most popular languages out there today, if I search for a job on the internet right now for Java, I think my browser will probably crash. I think because the popularity of phone applications is so high, Java will always be in demand. Every day we see more and more businesses that puts out some sort of phone application, and many of them use Java.
•	Future: I believe that Java’s popularity will only increase because as technology changes, especially with mobile devices, we can only assume that the main program out there will be Java that makes those languages adapt to whatever device we’ll need. Android phones are getting more and more popular and they all use Java just like most of the fortune 500 companies, so it is safe to say it is not going anywhere.
•	Community: There are many Java community out there and the most effective one is set up by Oracle. I still don’t think it’s nowhere near as organized as the MSDN’s or as usable. 
•	Expertise: Beginner because I am well under 100 hours of practice with Java.



Framework three: Python
•	Popularity: Python is a language that continues to grow in popularity especially in the field of research and data manipulations. Most fortune 500 businesses tend to lean away from java unless they want to use this language strictly for research.
•	Future: The popularity of python will continue to increase every year in areas of research, but not in the business side of the companies.
•	Community: There are several communities out there for python and one is called python weekly, it’s a great place to get tutorials and watch videos on questions that you might have.
•	Expertise: beginner.



Framework four: JavaScript
•	Popularity: This is probably the best language to know now, especially if one is think about spending a few years creating front end development. Out of the languages I have selected JavaScript is the most popular one, especially with the fortune 500 companies.
•	Future: The popularity of JS will only increase because everything is moving more and more towards do it yourself online. 
•	Community: The JS community is huge, however it’s difficult to find one that is still better than MSDN website or as helpful.
•	Expertise: None/beginner.


Tools to Use:

.NET: Visual Studios will probably what I use as my IDE because it has some very interesting features that I’ll need to develop my project with. One of those things will be WPF application, where I can create the GUI simple. The programming language that I will be using with it is C#. Through MSDN there I will be able to reference many libraries. The GUI’s will be simple to test and modify.

JAVA: The IDE that might work for me for this project will be either Net Beans or Eclipse. The java programming language is a curly bracket based a lot like the C languages. There are many libraries out there with useful tutorials on them as well. The designing tool is very limited with Eclipse but there are more options with Net beans, however, not as much as visual studios WPF application. Testing should be simple with the Net Beans.

Python: The IDE that might work well could be PyCharm because it seems much more user friendly. The best version out there is the 3.6.3. There are many libraries out there with some providing examples and tutorials. This might be much harder to build GUI’s in and test as well.  


Cost of Learning:
.NET, Java, Python: Using these framework, it is going to cost me at least 16 hour and probably more on each one of these frameworks because I have less than 100 hour of experience on all of them. No matter what framework I go with, it is going to cost me well over 140 hours to learn all 7 of the tools required to complete this project on the language of choice.
