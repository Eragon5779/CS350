## Cost of Learning

Use the [Drefus Model](DreyfusModel.md) to assess your current skill level.

Assess your experience level by counting hours you have spent using each tool or technology.

For each technology that you have spent less than 100 hours with, add 16 hours to the project cost estimate.

Total the number of hours you will need to learn the tools. 

Maximum tools cost = 7 tools * 20 hrs/tool = 140 hours

This is the startup cost that must be paid before you can produce value for the project.
