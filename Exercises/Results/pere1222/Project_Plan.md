Project Plan

#Phase 1 – Prototype 

##Sign In page 
 	- Sign form connecting to database 
 	- Data validation that checks the username isn’t taken yet 
 	- Database to storage information 
 	- Verification of the account through email 


The user is interested into joining to the website so he/she fills the signing form and submits the information: she/he needs to use an unique email that hasn’t been use yet to create an account, if the email is already taken a message will pop-up. Later, his/her information is saved in the database and she/he receives an account confirmation link to her/his email. 

##Login page 
- Login form
 	- Checks that the email and password are correct and are in the database 
 	- Lost password link to recovery page
 	- Recovery process for the account 

The user is back to the website and wants to log in using her/his email and password, but the password is incorrect the first time and the user cannot remember her/his password. The user clicks in the recover password and is redirected to another page to recover the password through his/her email. The user recovers the password and can finally log in into the main page. 

#Phase 2 -- Minimum Viable Product 

##Main (Feeds) page 
 	- User profile (wall/biography) no images just text 
 	- Feeds page with users search bar 
 	- “Add” button to send friendship requests Friends and “Deny” to deny their friendship     requests in profiles
 	- User’s activity board that only your friends can see (text only) 

Once the user has logged in, he/she is redirected to the feeds page where he/she can see the activities of his/her friends and click into his/her profile. If the user wants to add somebody else he/she can use the search bar and then add them by clicking the add button. The other user will have to accept the friendship request to be followed or can deny the request. 

#Phase 3 -- Fully Viable 

##Extra features in Feed page 
 	- Ability to upload content: text, videos or pictures on activity board 
 	- Chat 
 	- Customize profile picture 
 	- Add likes to activities, pictures or videos 

The user is now able to upload content, pictures or videos, to the activity board that will be later saved into his/her profile so other users can see them. The user is also able to chat with other accepted users to tell them about their just uploaded pictures. The user can now customize a profile picture. All users that are into the friend’s list can add likes to any picture, video or comment.
