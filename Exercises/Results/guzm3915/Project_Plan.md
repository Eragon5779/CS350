**Business**

**Phase 1**
  * **User abilities**
      * **Prototype**
        * Users should be able to make an account through the site that holds their information, and be able to log into that account with a secured password.
        * Users will have the ability to see and edit basic information about their profile.
        * All user information will be stored in a location on the server, primarily based on infrastructure made by the backend team.
        * All basic user GUI elements are present, such as navigation bars, and easy access to account information, mostly done by QA and Front End.
     
      * **Minimum Viable Product**
        * Users should be able to do all basic functions of a social media. The core 4 include posting messages to a board, connecting to other user profiles, being able to view messages from those profiles, and being able to edit data on those profiles and user information.
        * Basic privacy settings in place.
        * Backend will have a full database structure set out for users’ information, and possible integration for future updates and features.
        * Front end will have a user-friendly way for users to edit their information, and how the posts will look to the users.
      * **Fully Viable Product**
        * Users will be able to customize notification settings, and have access to a private message system. At this stage, the requirements would branch out into possible app development.
        * Backend database will branch to include message history for private messaging between users to be able to scroll back on and look at. 
        * Backend will have a fully developed database, complete with easy integration for any future updates.
        * Front End will have a fully made and nicely structured GUI for the users to build upon and connect with others that is very easy to understand for the older viewing base. Possible hovertips, warnings for typos, or other small features such as that. 
**User stories**
  * **Rena**
      * “I thought the site was simply fantastic. My grandchildren are always going on and on about how I need to branch out in my social networks, and suggested I take a look at this site. It was very simple and step by step to make an account. I put in my information, and in clear text, it told me what it needed and where I should type it. I was able to find some of my other friends and family on here as well, and the screen made the button to add them to my list of friends very noticeable and easy. I can post with ease, and need’nt worry about messing anything up.”
  * **Wes**
      * “I don’t really like social medias, but this one is pretty good. I found my mom on here, and she takes to this much easier than Facebook. I honestly see why, too. The layout is very user friendly. Buttons and font are large for older people to be able to see what they are looking at, the layout is very sequential for knowing how to tell a much older person the step to go through to do any of the functions such as posting, and I can keep my notifications about it all to a minimum from all the friends and connections I have through it myself.”
  * **Stephanie**
      * “My mom and I used to only find time in the day to call eachother once or twice. Now because of this site, Im able to see pictures she posts throughout the day, and I get notified right when she does, or mentions my name! I can keep in constant contact with her through the personal messenger, and we can chat away in the times where she cannot simply call me up, or needs to ask me something in a hurry.”
  * **Rosa**
      * “I use this app to keep in contact with all of my children. They might not need the site themselves, but they directed me to it, I made an account, and they did as well, so they could all message me and check in with me through here, seeing as I don’t have enough money for a phone plan, and the nursing home I stay at has offered me a laptop to keep in contact with people. Im definitely going to show this to the rest of the girls here at the home so we can talk without having to need the nurses lead us around every time we want to socialize.”
