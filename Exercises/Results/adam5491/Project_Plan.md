**User Stories**

**Registration**

 A user will register for an account. They will begin by giving their email, full name, birthday, a profile picture, and optionally a phone number. They will then fill out some other basic information like place of business and hobbies. Afterwards, the user can search for friends and add them. They can look at their own profile and see any statuses that they&#39;ve posted.

**Login**

 A user will want to login to their account from a different, public computer. On the login page, they will enter either their username or their email, and then enter their password. The user will decide not to check the remember me box since they&#39;re on a public computer. After they&#39;re done scrolling through their news feed, they will hit the logout button in the upper right.

**News Feed**

 A user is on their news feed, the home page of the site. They decide to post a status about their new dog, and include a picture of it. After the status posts, the user decides to scroll through their news feed and look at their friends&#39; lives. They thumbs up and comment on a picture of one of their friends, and get in a small argument in the comments of the status of another friend. The user sees a picture that says &quot;Share if you&#39;re not afraid to say you love Jesus&quot; and feels obligated to share the picture.

**Hosting**

 The user in this case is the person running the site. The user sets up the website on a web server, and waits for accounts to be made. They routinely make version backups and database backups.
