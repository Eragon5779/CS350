### User Stories
* Profile
  * The user should be able to create a new profile. During the profile creation the user should be able to enter their username, password, email address, and optionally their age. Then the user should have the ability to sign-in to their profile, as well as sign-out of their profile. Then if a user no longer enjoys the application, the user should be able to delete their profile.   
* Pages
  * A user should be able to create a new page with content that they enjoy. A page should include text of the content and a user can have a picture associated with the page if the creator wants one. The user should be able to display the page to other users who enjoy similar content. The page owner should be able to see how many followers the page has to determine if they want to keep adding content to the page.

* Threading
  * When a user signs-in to their profile, their home page should display a main thread. That main thread should consist of content that the user enjoys, which will be determined by what they follow. The thread should only consist of recent content from the user’s followed pages. When a user clicks on a page, the page should have a thread of its own, that page should have content related to the page, posted by other users who enjoy the same content. If content is added to the page thread that is not related, the page owner should be able to remove the post from the thread.  

* Following
  * When a user clicks on a page, and enjoys the content of the page, the user should be able to follow the page. The page should have a follower count, so that other users can see how many other people enjoy the same content. If the user decides that the page content is no longer of their enjoyment the user should be able to stop following the page. If a page has a user who posts inappropriate content the page owner has the ability to block a user from following their page.
