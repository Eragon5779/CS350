## User Stories

### Log-in Page

As an SMT user, I want to be able to create a new account for SMT. When I first open SMT there should be obvious text entry sections where I can type an email address and password to create and account. Once my account is created I need to be able to return to the log-in page and enter my new credentials to the site. I would like to have the ability to reset my password in case I forget it.

### Profile

As an SMT user, I would like to be able to input information about myself so other users can verify my identity. I would like my profile page to contain areas to update my picture, birthday, gender, and a short bio about myself. To upload a picture I want to be able to click on the current profile picture and be given an option to change the picture. For my birthday I would like 3 drop down menus for month, day, and year. For my gender I would like a dropdown menu to select male, female, or other. My bio will be a text window to type whatever I would like.

### Main Page

As an SMT user, I want a main page where I can see the status updates from my friends. I also want to be able to post my own status updates my friends will see. I want the ability to comment on my friends’ statuses. I want to be able to access the Main Page and see the newest statuses at the top to avoid seeing posts I have already seen.

### Friends List

As an SMT user, I want a page dedicated to listing my current friends. I want this page to contain a search feature to find new friends. I would like to be able to type in a friends name and be given a list of results for possible friends. I would like to be able to deny friend requests from other users if I do not know them. I would like the ability to sort my friends based on when I “met” them as well as by information provided by them on their profile page.
