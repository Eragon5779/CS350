Technology Plan

Frameworks:

1.	Ruby on Rails

a.	Popularity – Ruby on Rails seems quite popular for web applications. Wikipedia states “As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.

b.	Future – With its rising popularity in web apps it seems Ruby will be around for a while, however there were some security concern recently (http://news.mit.edu/2016/patching-web-applications-0415)

c.	Community – RoR seems to have good support with such forums as https://gorails.com/forum

d.	Expertise – Seems RoR is most used for web applications

2.	Python/Django

a.	Popularity - https://hotframeworks.com/ gives Django an overall score of 92/100 just a couple below RoR

b.	Future – I don’t have a source for this but it seems scripting in general is becoming the new baseline for being employed. While in the past having typing or Microsoft word skills was almost a given, it seems having basic scripting skills will be a given in the future. With that in mind it makes sense for Python to be a large part of the future since it is so readable and intuitive for new programmers.

c.	Community – seems to have a good community with a semiannual conference called “DjangoCon”

d.	Expertise – Mostly used for web applications

3.	AngularJS

a.	Popularity – AngularJS has the second highest ranking on https://hotframeworks.com/ with an overall score of 97/100

b.	Future – It seems AngularJS is staying popular in the development world according to https://blog.resellerclub.com/the-future-of-angularjs-is-it-worth-learning.

c.	Community – With multiple online forums and the Angular Connect Conference, Angular JS seems to have a large support community.

d.	Expertise – Mostly used for web applications
