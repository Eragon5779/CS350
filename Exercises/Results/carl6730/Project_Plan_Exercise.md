## Registration

User Story:

As an end user, I want to be able to register so that I can have an account. As an end user, I want to be able to log in so that I can create posts and read other user&#39;s posts.

Use Case:

In order to utilize the application for posting status updates and reading status updates posted by other users the user will need to register an account. The user will log in to this account. Authentication will be required each time the user accesses the application from a new device.

- Users will be able to access a web form and enter required information in order to register a new account
- Users will be required to register with a unique email address
- Users will be able to access login authentication form
- Users will be able to use credentials from registration to log in to their account

## Create Post \*\*

User Story:

As an end user, I want to be able to create and publish a status update so that I can share my thoughts with other users. As an end user, I want to be able to edit and delete my posts so that I can take care of accidental typos, or posts that are no longer wanted.

Use Case: In order for posts to be readable on the forum, users will need the ability to write and publish their status updates. The user will login, click &quot;post new update&quot; and enter text of up to 500 characters. Once finished, the user will press &quot;publish update&quot; to submit and post their

status update.

- Users will be able to access a web form and create a text-only status update or post
- Users will be able to submit or cancel from this web form
- Upon submission, the web post will be added to the forum post feed
- Users will also be able to delete their own posts

## View Posts \*\*

User Story:

As an end user, I want to be able to view other user&#39;s status updates so that I can know what is on other users&#39; minds.

Use Case: All posts created on the application will be visible to all logged in users. A user will login and then land on the feed page, where they can see the top 10 most recent posts published by other users.

- Users will be able to view all other users posts in the forum post feed
- Posts will be displayed in most recent order
- Users will be able to refresh feed and see new posts by clicking a refresh button in the interface
- Posts will include the poster&#39;s name followed by their text-only status update

## Edit Account Info

User Story:

As an end user, I want to be able to edit my account information so that I can fix mistakes or make other necessary updates.

Use case: The user might get a new email address, or need to update their name due to marriage, divorce etc. For this reason, the user will be able to click &quot;edit account info&quot; and make changes to these fields, which will update them in the database and within the user interface.

- Users will be able to access a web form in order to edit their account details (first name, last name, email address)
- Users will be required to have an email address associated with their account (cannot remove if a new one isn&#39;t exchanged)
- Users will be able to update and submit changes
- Users will be able to cancel changes and go back without any data being updated
