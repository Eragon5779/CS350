# Framework Selection

|   | Popularity | Future | Community | Expertise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | One of the most popular and widely used JavaScript frameworks | Expected to continue to raise in popularity and usage | From nodejs.org: &quot;The Node.js community is large, inclusive, and excited to enable as many users to contribute in whatever way they can.&quot; | I am most familiar with node.js as I use it to write and deploy automated tests at my job using webdriver-js but would say I am **between beginner and competent** |
| Ruby on Rails | According to TechMagic, Ruby was the most popular framework from around 2005 to 2012, but since then has been surpassed by node.js | Is expected to take a slow downturn from its glory days | From rubyonrails.org: &quot;Ruby on Rails is for everyone who wants to build web applications, whether they&#39;re 30-year veterans or only just started to learn yesterday. All are welcome!&quot; | The legacy app at the startup that I work for was built using Ruby on Rails so I am familiar with the MVC concept and how it works, but would still be **beginner** |
| ASP.net | ASP.net was once the law of the land and remains one of the top used frameworks but has been surpassed by new frameworks such as Node.js and Ruby on Rails | Some feel that ASP.net is going into &quot;maintenance mode&quot; while others believe it will hold strong its share of the market | Slightly less of a community although they do have a community forum for announcements etc. [https://www.asp.net/community](https://www.asp.net/community) | I have created a few programs using visual studio but I am the least versed in the Microsoft side of programming, so very much **beginner** |



# Tools to Use for Social Networking application:

## IDE: Atom.io

I am familiar with Atom, and while it&#39;s not a standalone IDE I have several add-ons that I use specifically to make it an IDE, I have spent at least 100 hours using Atom.io

## Version Control: GitHub

I have some experience with GitHub uploading my automated testing files, but since I am the only one on the project I haven&#39;t had to be super careful. I&#39;d say less than 100 hours, so +16

## Programming language: JavaScript

I might have 100 hours writing automated tests in JavaScript but because this is very specific to WebDriver , so  + 16

## Code Libraries: Sails.js and JQuery

I have some experience with both, but not 100 hours. +16

## Design Tools: Sketch, Invision and LucidChart

Sketch for actual mock design, Invision for clickable prototype and LucidChart for diagrams. I am very familiar with all 3 of these using them almost daily at work, so no hours to be added here.

## Hosting: AWS

While I&#39;m familiar with the concepts and have seen this up and running, I still have a lot to learn. +16

## Testing Framework: WebdriverJS, xcode

WebdriverJS for automated tests, xcode for cross-platform testing.

# Start-up Cost: 64 hours
