## User Stories

### User Registration –
A user goes to our website and wants to create an account. They are asked for some personal information (email, name etc.) as well as a username and password. After an account has been created the user must be able to log in to their account. They should also be able to log out of their account once they are logged in. The user will be able to go to their personal account and edit their information. If they decide they don’t want to keep their account there needs to be a way for the user to decide to delete their account. After providing their account login information and confirming they want to leave the service all of their account data and posts will be deleted. 

### Publishing posts-
After the user has created their account they must be able to make posts from their account. It should be easy for the user to create a new post and decide what they want to place in it like writing, images or videos. After the user has created a post they want to share with the world they should be able to hit a post button. This will save the post in the database and make it available for other friends to see. After posting their “status” the user should be able to go in and change the information in the post like fixing misspellings and such. Also, if the user decides they hate what they posted and wish it never happened they will be able to delete a post and remove it from the public eye.

### Displaying posts-
When a user is logged in they should have a wall of their friend’s posts. They should be able to see what their friends have said as well as see their own posts with comments. These posts should be displayed in a timely fashion with the newest posts being at the top. This will keep the page fresh for users and organize the content.  The user should be able to click a button on the post and be able to make comments about their or their friends posts. To this end the user must be able to clearly see who has posted which status. The user who posted the status will the pictured along with their status. 

### Hosting-
The users need to be able to reach the website at a distinct, nonchanging URL. When the user creates their account, they should trust that the system will be able to store all their data into a database to consolidate all of the information in one easy to access place. Websites need to be continually maintained and updated so there will need to be a system to store the versions of the website. This will keep the current version running on the website and allow for other versions to be developed. Along with this once an updated version is complete they will need to be able to post this latest version to the domain without damaging peoples info or posts.
