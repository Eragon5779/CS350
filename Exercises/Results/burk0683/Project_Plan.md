Phase 1 will include a site that can you can sign-up with, make a few posts that are stored, and be able to log out. There will be a very basic covering of the essential requirements, with rough design. Modifications to these requirements may need to take place, but before Phase 2 hits full development.


## Phase 2

Phase 2 will include a site that is able to function fully within the specs of the essential requirements. A case study will take place during Phase 2 to see what features are missing, with modifications to the environment based on user input. As development continues, more microstudies will take place, getting user feedback based on tasks set to see how viable all features are. All major requirements should be finalized quickly after beginning Phase 2 of development, as major requirement changes result in major refactoring, causing longer development time.

## Phase 3

Phase 3 is the final stage of the development, fleshing out all of the requirements and features that are needed for the full product. Important and core features should be developed first, and additional features should be prioritized within 1 week of Phase 3 beginning, should there be extra development time after the FVP is finished.





# User Stories

## Carol
	Today, I logged into Social Retirement and had a nice little chat with Becky. We had been talking about our kids at the knitting club, and realized that we were both on Social Retirement, as our children had set up the accounts for us. I sent her a friend request, and minutes later, we were sending each other messages, chatting about everything. Then, I made a post to my page, and she commented on it and asked me if I could share my phone number with her. I went to the help page, and it had some very nice directions on how to change my security settings to allow Becky to view my phone number. It was really easy, and I think I am starting to get used to this social media thing!

## Ben
	My friend Becky told me about this thing called Social Retirement this afternoon. She said it was on the internet, and you used it to talk to all of your friends that are in retirement. So I used the Google to look it up, and sure enough, there it was! It had instructions on how to get started, and in a few minutes, I had found her and sent her a message thanking her for recommending the site to me! I talked to her for a while, and we set up a date to go get tea and scones tomorrow morning. I hope Ron isn’t mad.

## Ron
	I was on Social Retirement this morning, and saw a post from Becky talking about how her and Ben had gone out for tea and scones. Tea and scones? Is he British or something? Anyways. I went to Ben’s page to see if I could find his address so I could go and talk to him face-to-face, but I noticed that it didn’t show any information about Ben since we weren’t friends. So I sent him a request, which he accepted, but even then, it still didn’t show me the address! He must have it set so only certain friends can see his address (like Becky). I asked him if he would give me his address, but he said no, and that he would talk to me later because he was with Becky getting dinner. The nerve! On a side note, the website is really nice, and obviously has good privacy so people can’t stalk each other… Oh wait.
