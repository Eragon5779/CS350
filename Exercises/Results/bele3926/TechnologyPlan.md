| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASP.NET | It is so popular and its Stack Overflow score is 100 | ASP.NET have great future because of its great feature like a) attribute based routing b) generating code using scaffolding c) filter overrides | In ASP.NET community there are lots of knowledge sharing and issues resolving through Stack Overflow, Blogs, Twitter, GitHub  |   |
| Angular.JS  | Popular and its Stack Overflow score is 97 |   AngularJS is a JavaScript framework which can be added to an HTML page with &lt;script&gt; tag maintained by Google. It is used to build powerful, interactive websites with sleek animations to offer pleasant user experiences. And the popularity of AngularJS has risen significantly in the past couple of years and so has the demand for developers.  | Angular.JS community helps other developers learn and work with AngularJS. |   |
| Ruby on Rails | Popular and its Stack Overflow score is 98 |    For those enterprises which are working on full-stack web applications, Ruby on Rails will remain an attractive option. However, there is no denying that the roads of front-end development and back-end development are diverging from each other. The full-stack single-app is becoming orthodoxy and is no longer the best practice. The emerging structure is to have an API/Gateway layer housed in the back-end framework which will play the role of a dedicated foundation to your front-end app. This structure is placed in the context of developments like client-side JavaScript frameworks, microservices and mobile apps. Rails still works with rails-API. Though Node is well-established, it is not prominently recommended for the back-end stacks. Phoenix and Elixir are the new entrants and have pros which appeal to Ruby on Rails developers looking for change.   | Ruby-on-Rails is not just an open-source technology, but uses open-source code and most importantly, belongs to an open-source community. Long-drawn complex projects, new libraries and bug fixes among other things are highly benefited from the community of developers in Ruby-on-Rails. |   |
