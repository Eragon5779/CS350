# Development Exercise

## Test Driven Development

This exercise will step you through the process of doing test-first 
development. All work is completed by taking small steps toward a goal.
The ultimate goal is reached by completing smaller goals which in turn are 
broken down into smaller tasks.


## Development Loop Setup

Productive development require both tools and process.  This exercise is intended to teach
techniques for defining an effective development loop.

Dev Loop:

* Select a feature to build
* Create a test for the desired feature - test must fail
* Build code (one line) to pass test
* Refactor - clean up all technical debt


## Tools to Configure

For this exercise you will need to setup the following tools.

* Github Account - UNC-CS350
* Documents\CS350 Windows directory - Download a zip file of the CS350 repo and unpack it here.
* Python
* Google Chrome

Follow these steps to get going

* Download a zip file of the CS350 repo and unpack it at Documents\CS350.
* Edit Documents\CS350\Exercises\tools.py with IDLE.
* To run a file in IDLE use F5.
* Do one thing until it is complete.
* Debug the test code at the end of the file to get all of the features working.
	* Edit
	* Browse
	* Github
	* Google
	* UNC
	* Explore

Enhance these functions to make them more useful.


## File Readers and Writers

Next we will turn on several file readers and writers.

Select each of the following files and complete the missing code.

Pass the tests while writing the smallest amount of code.

* Text Files - file_text.py
* JSON Files - file_json.py
* CSV Files  - file_csv.py
