# Dreyfus Model for Learning New Skills

Any given skill will have different levels of proficiency. The Dreyfus Scale
gives us a mental model for how we acquire new skills. It has five different
phases that each have some characteristic attributes.

## Novice - More than 1 hour

* Doesn't know much about the subject
* May be familiar with high-level concepts and key words
* Shouldn't be trusted to accomplish any goal

## Beginner - More than 10 hour

* Basic understanding but needs a simple set of rules to follow
* Can't deal with unexpected situations
* Can succeed at well-defined tasks but needs supervision

## Competent - More than 100 hour

* Able to build recipes for others to follow
* Can deliver reliable results and recover from errors
* Treats every situation the same (can't appreciate important differences)

## Proficient - More than 1,000 hour

* Views the complexity of each nuance
* Often good at teaching others
* Can quickly solve all problems that arise
* Treats every situation as unique

## Expert - More than 10,000 hour

* Operates largely by intuition
* Success without thinking
