As a dog owner, I want a way for my dog to meet other dogs in the modern age, so that he can benefit from the advancements of technology we as a species have made. I need an easy way to make a profile for my dog in a simple way.

 	I need to be able to talk about my dog, his/her likes and dislikes, and show him/her off to other dog owners to see if they think our dogs would get along. Like most living animals, my dogs likes and dislikes change so I need flexibility in my dog's profile.

The main reason for a social site for dogs is to see other dogs and look for potential matches that my dog might enjoy. While seeing pictures will help me get to know who my dog will meet, I need to also be able to read what other dog owners have written about theirs dogs so that I may make an informed decision for a play date or not. If the we owners think our dogs will get along well we need to be able to set up a time and place to meet.
